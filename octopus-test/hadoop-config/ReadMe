Hadoop 2.4.0 Under Different Distributed File System.

	---Alluxio(newest Version)
	---NRFS(Implemented by Youmin and Weijian)
	---HDFS(Default filesytem under Hadoop)

For Alluxio and NRFS, please start DFS and Yarn first with
primary configuration, and update your corresponding conf-
iguration file later.

When runing benchmark(such as WordCount, TeraGen...), please
add full path at the end of your command.
(eg. ./bin/hadoop jar ...example.jar wordcount nrfs:///a nrfs:///b)

TestDFSIO is designed with built-in file path, How to solve it?
